		<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
		important contribution to our understanding of cognitive effort. </p>

		<p>The purpose of this study was to invesigate how rewards (money) contributes to
       how people view cognitive effort. Cognitive effort is usually thought of as
       the amount of mental energy needed to accomplish some task. Generally speaking,
       effort is aversive -- people tend to avoid spending it when they can.
       However, we still use effort all of the time because it confers some benefit.
       For example, we may spend a lot of mental effort studying for an exam, because doing so will secure us
      a good grade. </p>

    <p> Given the central role effort plays in our life, it is of interest to us how people introspect about effortful tasks.
    In particular, we are interested in how rewards can affect this perception. For instance, does being paid more make something feel easier, or more jutified?</p>

    <p>In this study, we hypothesized that by paying people different amounts for the same difficult cognitive task (the N-back at its different levels),
    we could control how effortful they would perceive the task. "How effortful" the task was to you was captured by the questions you rated on a sliding scale
  after each round of the N-back. Our prediction is that being paid more for a demanding task will reduce how effortful that task is perceived to be.</p>

		<p>If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
		principal investigator, Sean Devine (seandamiandevine@gmail.com).</p>
